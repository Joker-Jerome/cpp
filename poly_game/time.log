I discussed my solution with: stackoverflow

Discussion:
1. When it comes to the structure and algorithm, this homework assignment is not that hard. There is no need to use very complicated algorithm and the program is fast. 
2. Dealing with the object oriented programming with C++ is a little bit difficult, becuase the syntax is different, I still need some efforts to get used to the specific data structures of C++, different constructors and so on.
3. One of the most tricky part is to do the data input and output with C++ for this program, using corresponding functions of C++ is not convenient. For this assignment, since there are different types of input and arguments, dealing with them is a little bit hard. 
4. It is my first time to come across a test like test08, I basically checked every methods and every statement, it seemed everything was fine. However, it failed. Finally I put the "static const int SIZE" to the public and solve the problem. 
5. Exception handling is still a big issue, in this assignment there are a wide variety of inptus and I spent lots of time thinking of the possible errors to ensure the program can run gracefully.
